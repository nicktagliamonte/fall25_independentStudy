1. enforced 7 copies (note: on old system!!!)
  - both legacy and uvr flows clamp n >= 7 (including dynamic n)
  - imported/forwarded requests start from the clamped value and decrement per hop
2. added read-time consensus
  - when getting a cid, we gather copies from peers (libp2p if available, shared fallback otherwise)
  - compute content-hash per copy and pick the majority
  - if local differs from majority, repair the local copy to match
  - if fewer than 7 agreeing copies exist, trigger replication until we have 7
3. updated the paper to reflect these changes
  - documented the 7-replica minimum and majority content-hash
  - explained bft for content integrity via majority on reads
  - clarified immutability: modified content => new cid => fresh replication
4. verified builds and tests are grean
5. prepping sng40 tie-in:
  - cloned sng40
  - branched
  - created new dir "go"
  - ran go mod init github.com/nicktagliamonte/tuple-integration
  - ran go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/nicktagliamonte
  - ran go get github.com/nicktagliamonte/fall25_independentStudy
  - split the contents of package main into a thin cli wrapper and the contents of pkg/ so that it can be imported
  - created a minimal main.go in sng40 and imported pkg/
  - ran go mod tidy and verified it was working
  - ran go build ../bin/p2p_integration
  - added a top level makefile target
