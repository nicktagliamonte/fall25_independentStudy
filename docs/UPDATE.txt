1. enforced 7 copies (note: on old system!!!)
  - both legacy and uvr flows clamp n >= 7 (including dynamic n)
  - imported/forwarded requests start from the clamped value and decrement per hop
2. added read-time consensus
  - when getting a cid, we gather copies from peers (libp2p if available, shared fallback otherwise)
  - compute content-hash per copy and pick the majority
  - if local differs from majority, repair the local copy to match
  - if fewer than 7 agreeing copies exist, trigger replication until we have 7
3. updated the paper to reflect these changes
  - documented the 7-replica minimum and majority content-hash
  - explained bft for content integrity via majority on reads
  - clarified immutability: modified content => new cid => fresh replication
4. verified builds and tests are grean
