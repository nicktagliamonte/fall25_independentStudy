1. implement N-hop stub 
    - make sure it exists as a library function or generally speaking that tsh can use it
    - include logging structure
2. replace or wrap the tuple space comm layer (i.e. route tuple updates over libp2p instead of native sockets)
    - MAYBE
    - looking at this, it feels poorly motivated
    - i mean if the tsh works as-is and the file sharing layer is p2p then isn't that sufficient?
3. build out N-hop stub, 7 node min, statistical liveness guarantee (i.e. all the paper changes from the 11_06 update should exist in this NEW repo now)


as far as i can tell, that's it. we'll then have a paper, n-hop, p2p in sng, idk what would be left to do
once things actually test well, and once we can figure out distributed testing, we're good
