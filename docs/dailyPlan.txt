add directory transfer
test locally
    just make sure everything still works (daemon and non- and also file and data)
test on two machines (i.e. mine and like...chameleon)
    - spin both with background daemons; record peerids and addrs; swap
    - run put/get across both directions; capture logs + timings
    - include negative tests (verack timeout, bad agent/services)
start the sng40<>go conversion
    pay attention to the "hostfile" which exists in there...somewhere
