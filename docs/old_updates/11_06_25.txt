- Removed traversal worker, leadership election, and lease-based failure detection from the codebase.
  - Deleted all worker/leader/lease code paths and imports.
  - Adjusted coordination to operate without heartbeats or traversal.

- Introduced per-message tuple self-checks for ongoing health.
  - After any successful tuple GET, the receiver verifies its manifest against expected CIDs.
  - Missing or divergent content is repaired by fetching the majority-hash consensus copy.
  - Continues to enforce N >= 7 by triggering replication when needed.

- Hardened hash-consensus enforcement.
  - If local content disagrees with majority for any CID, the node re-emits replication intents for its entire manifest (to preserve >=7 copies) and then shuts down (self-quarantine).
  - This excises faulty/malicious nodes while preserving durability; we do not attempt node repair.

- Paper updates.
  - Abstract and body now present per-message self-checks as the mechanism (no traversal/leases).
  - Updated Replication/Transport section to describe self-checks and self-quarantine on consensus breach.
  - Introduction/semantics/diffusion wording revised: removed repair claims; clarified deterministic ring order (not traversal worker).
  - Removed two formal items tied to heartbeats/failure detection: the Detection Bound lemma and the Fault Repair Correctness subsection (and adjusted related proposition wording).
  - Improved Limitations flow; clarified BFT via majority content-hash and file immutability; updated Summary to “bounded coordination delays.”

- Build/run check: builds clean; daemon smoke-run completes startup.

- cgo: Expose TSH operations to Go via a thin C shim and Go package; no changes to existing C.
  - Definition: cgo enables Go and C interoperability via generated bindings; requires a C toolchain and crosses the language boundary.
  - C shim `libtshshim.a` forwards requests, including multi-stage UVR flows over a return socket; ABI is `tsh/tsh_cgo.h`. Inputs/outputs use pre-allocated buffers and existing structs.
  - Go package `go/core/tshcgo` provides typed wrappers and generic dispatch; errors retain {op, code, source(errno|status), message}.
  - Generated constants/tests from `include/synergy.h` keep op sets in lockstep (`go/cmd/tshopsgen`).
  - Single cgo compilation unit; exported op enums (`CGO_TSH_OP_*`).
  - Bounded reads/writes; deadlines propagate to socket timeouts.
  - Build: `make -C tsh libtshshim` (or `libtshshim_all`); in `go/`: `go generate ./... && go build ./...`.
  - Test: `go test ./...` (integration via `TSH_TEST_ENDPOINT=host:port`); CLI `go/cmd/tshcli` mirrors Go usage.
  - Layout: C shim `tsh/tsh_cgo.c`, headers `include/synergy.h`; Go API `go/core/tshcgo`; generator `go/cmd/tshopsgen`; CLI `go/cmd/tshcli`; docs `go/README.md`.
  - Next: gate "go generate then git diff --exit-code" in CI; add typed helpers as new ops are exercised; add microbenchmarks for multi-stage flows.

  - Integrated external P2P base layer (`github.com/nicktagliamonte/fall25_independentStudy`) via a dedicated adapter with clean Start/Close lifecycle and callbacks for handshake/ack.
  - Added pass-through data plane with size bounds and backpressure: `PutRaw` and `GetRawFrom` delegate to the P2P service, enforce `maxBytes`, and use a bounded semaphore.
  - Introduced typed errors for data-plane operations (operation code + error code + message) and ensured clear “not running/unavailable/timeout/too_large/upstream” signaling.
  - Exposed a JSON-safe `Status` surface including peer ID, addrs, head/height, node metrics, last handshake/ack, topics, and adapter-local counters (handshakes, acks, tx/rx blocks, errors).
  - Emitted structured logs for control- and data-plane events with peer IDs and byte counts to aid debugging and telemetry.
  - Provided CLI toggles to enable/inspect the adapter without impacting existing TSH sockets; adapter remains off by default.
  - Established module linkage and env-driven configuration (`replicate.Config` with `FromEnv()`), and documented local development options (`go.work` / `replace`) while preferring the remote module.
  - Added unit tests for config parsing, typed errors, and backpressure; gated adapter integration tests behind `-tags p2p_lib` and `SNG_P2P_IT=1`.
